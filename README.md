app.py
The app.py file serves as the main application interface and controller for the project, built using the Streamlit library. It manages the user experience by handling file uploads and device/time format selection in the sidebar, controlling the overall layout with custom CSS, and offering a dropdown to choose between 'Overall' or individual user analysis.

preprocess.py
The preprocess.py module is responsible for the critical task of converting the raw, unstructured WhatsApp chat text file into a clean, structured Pandas DataFrame suitable for analysis. It uses regular expressions (re) to parse the chat log, matching specific timestamp and date patterns determined by the user's selected device type and time format (e.g., Android 12-hour or iOS 24-hour). After separating the date from the raw message, it cleans the timestamp strings and converts them into the proper datetime format. It then isolates the sender's name from the message content, classifying system notifications (messages without a colon separator) as 'Group_Notification', before extracting additional temporal features like the year, month, day_name, and hour, which are essential for downstream analytical and plotting functions.

helper.py
The helper.py file acts as the project's analytics engine, housing all the specialized functions that perform the data calculations and transformations required for visualization. It contains functions like fetch_stats to compute basic metrics (total messages, words, media, and links using URLExtract), fetch_most_active_users for participant engagement analysis, and functions like timeline and week_activity_map for temporal trend analysis. For qualitative analysis, it includes most_common_words (which filters out common words using stop_hinglish.txt and uses collections.Counter), create_wordcloud to generate the word frequency visualization, and emoji_helper to identify and count emoji usage. All of these functions take the processed DataFrame and the selected user/overall context as input, returning the final data structures or plots needed by app.py for display.
